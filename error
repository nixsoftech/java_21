ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  mapping values are not allowed in this context

The error appears to be in '/home/linuxadmin/playbook/test/play1.yml': line 65, column 20, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Phase 1: Upgrade from 18.04 to 20.04
                   ^ here
