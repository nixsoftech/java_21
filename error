ERROR! 'retries' is not a valid attribute for a Block

The error appears to be in '/opt/playbook/play10.yml': line 53, column 11, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


        - name: Monitor focal upgrade with aggressive connection recovery
          ^ here
