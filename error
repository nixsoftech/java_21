ERROR! 'retries' is not a valid attribute for a Block

The error appears to be in '/opt/playbook/play6.yml': line 63, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Monitor focal upgrade until completion
      ^ here
